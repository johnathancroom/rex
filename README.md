#### About
Created by [Matthew Helm](http://twitter.com/mtthlm)

I created this framework to eventually grow to complete with other popular frameworks, offering better functionality, better security, and better code.  Thanks to [Laravel](http://laravel.com), [Slim](http://slimframework.com), [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com), etc. for your inspiration, and efforts at making quality frameworks, but I'll take it from here.  I am seeking to take the best parts from other frameworks, make them better, and implement the same technology in my framework.  That's how technology advances after all right?

If you're looking for a coder, I'm your man.  Hopefully what I've done here will demonstrate that.

Stay around for more updates, information, and great code.  [Watch this repository](https://github.com/mtthlm/rex/toggle_watch)!
